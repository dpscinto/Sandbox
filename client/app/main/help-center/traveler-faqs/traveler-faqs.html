                <h2>Traveler FAQs</h2>
                <ul>


                    <li><strong>1) IS THE JRNY LOCAL A FULL-TIME TOUR GUIDE WHILE I’M THERE?</strong> NO. JRNY LOCALS PROVIDE PRE-TRIP PLANNING, ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS TO ENSURE YOU MAKE THE MOST OUT OF YOUR JRNY, HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT A TOUR GUIDE FOR YOUR JRNY. WHO WANTS SOMEONE TELLING YOU WHAT TIME TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING ANYWAYS?!</li>
                    <li><strong>2) CAN I ASK FOR ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS FROM THE JRNY LOCAL WHILE I’M THERE?</strong> NO. AT THIS TIME JRNY LOCALS PROVIDE PRE-TRIP PLANNING, ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS TO ENSURE YOU MAKE THE MOST OUT OF YOUR JRNY. THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO KEEP UP COMMUNICATION WITH THE TRAVELERS THROUGHOUT THEIR JRNY.</li>
                    <li><strong>3) DOES THE JRNY LOCAL MAKE ALL MY RESERVATIONS (FLIGHTS, ACCOMMODATION, ETC.)</strong> JRNY LOCALS PROVIDE ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS ABOUT FLIGHTS, ACCOMMODATION, RENTAL CARS, ETC BUT DO NOT MAKE THE RESERVATIONS FOR THE TRAVELER. HOWEVER, IF YOU’D LIKE A LOCAL TO MAKE A RESTAURANT RESERVATION (FOR EXAMPLE: A LANGUAGE BARRIER IS AN ISSUE) JUST ASK!</li>
                    <li><strong>4) WHAT IF I NEED TO MODIFY OR CANCEL MY JRNY?</strong> YOU CAN MODIFY OR CANCEL YOUR JRNY UNDER “MY JRNYS” ONCE YOU HAVE SIGNED INTO YOUR PROFILE. DEPENDING ON THE STATUS OF YOUR JRNY, YOU MAY RECEIVE PART OR FULL REFUND FOR YOUR JRNY.</li>
                    <li><strong>5) CAN I BE A JRNY LOCAL IN MY AREA?</strong> OF COURSE! DO YOU (BLAH, BLAH, BLAH) CHECK OUT THE “BECOME A LOCAL” PAGE TO APPLY.</li>

                    <li><strong>6)  WHAT IF I AM UNHAPPY WITH MY JRNY LOCAL? CAN I SWITCH?</strong> OUR GOAL IS THAT OUR TRAVELERS ARE 100% SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE THEY RECEIVE FROM THE JRNY LOCALS HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT SOME GROUPS JUST DON’T MESH. IN ORDER TO COMBAT THIS, JRNY LOCALS DON’T GET PAID UNTIL YOU APPROVE THE PROPOSED ITINERARY. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE LOCAL YOU ARE MATCHED WITH, PLEASE CONTACT US HERE AND WE WILL MATCH YOU WITH A DIFFERENT LOCAL.</li>
                    <li><strong>7) HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>8) I DON’T KNOW THE EXACT DATES I WANT TO TRAVEL, BUT I STILL WANT LOCAL ADVICE..</strong> WE ARE WORKING ON MAKING THIS PROCESS MORE FLUID. AT THIS TIME, OUR BEST ADVICE IS TO ENTER DATES SIMILAR TO WHEN YOU WILL BE VISITING. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO TAKE A LONG WEEKEND IN MAY, BUT ARE UNSURE OF THE EXACT DATES, ENTER ANY DATES OF A FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY IN MAY. YOU WILL BE MATCHED WITH A LOCAL WHO CAN START GIVING YOU ADVICE RIGHT AWAY. IF SOMETHING CHANGES, YOU CAN ALWAYS MODIFY THE DATES UNDER “MY JRNYS” ONCE YOU HAVE SIGNED INTO YOUR PROFILE.</li>
                    <li><strong>9) I AM TRAVELING FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND WANT TO USE JRNY IN MULTIPLE                     LOCATIONS. CAN I? DOES IT HAVE TO BE CONSECUTIVE DATES?',
            YES. YOU CAN USE JRNY IN MULTIPLE DESTINATIONS ON THE SAME RESERVATION. YOU WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO “ADD A DESTINATION” AFTER YOU HAVE ENTERED THE DETAILS FOR YOUR FIRST DESTINATION. NO. THE DATES DO NOT HAVE TO BE CONSECUTIVE, BUT EACH DESTINATION MUST BE WITHIN 14 DAYS IN ORDER TO BE ON THE SAME RESERVATION AND RECEIVE A DISCOUNT.</li>
            <li ><strong>10) CAN I TIP THE JRNY LOCAL FOR PROVIDING US WITH AN INCREDIBLE JRNY?</strong> YES! IF YOU’VE ENJOYED YOUR JRNY, SHOW THE LOCAL YOUR APPRECIATION BY TIPPING THEM THROUGH THE “MY JRNYS” SECTION OF YOUR PROFILE.</li>
