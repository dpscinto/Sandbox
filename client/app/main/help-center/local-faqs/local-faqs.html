                    <li><strong>2. WHAT IF I CAN’T STAND WORKING WITH A CERTAIN TRAVELER?</strong>JUST AS THE TRAVELER CAN OPT OUT OF WORKING WITH YOU, YOU CAN DO THE SAME WITH THEM. HOWEVER, KEEP IN MIND THAT WE KEEP TRACK OF THIS AND “IT’S NOT YOU, IT’S ME” ONLY WORKS SO MANY TIMES.</li>
                    <li><strong>3.CAN MY PARTNER AND I SIGN UP UNDER THE SAME ACCOUNT?</strong>YES! WE ENCOURAGE COUPLES TO SIGN UP UNDER THE SAME ACCOUNT. YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU ARE OFTEN PAIRED WITH MORE TRAVELERS WHO ARE COUPLES BECAUSE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WILL LIKE TO DO TOGETHER.</li>
                    <li><strong>4. AM I EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHEN TRAVELERS VISIT MY CITY?</strong> NO. YOU ARE NOT THEIR PERSONAL TOUR GUIDE. WE LET TRAVELERS KNOW THIS AHEAD OF TIME. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTACT YOU VIA WWW.ITSTHEJRNY.COM, BUT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED/EXPECTED TO ANSWER, HOWEVER IF YOU CHOOSE TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THE TRAVELERS THAT IS UP TO YOU. </li>
